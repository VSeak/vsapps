-- 3. Access rules -------------------------------------------------------------
-- Every coach can read every student, plan, session, note and goal. Only a student's current coach (or any
-- coach, for a student with no coach: can_coach()) changes them or replies to notes. Any coach adds Coach Notes
-- (the author or the student's coach edits them) and logs past sessions. Nobody coaches themselves.
-- Admins can read and change the staff list and students (not plans or goals).
-- A student can read their own row (and change their pronouns through
-- update_my_pronouns()), plans and sessions, read their current and
-- achieved goals (not archived ones), read notes on their sessions, and add or
-- delete their own notes.
-- Coach notes are for coaches only: students and admin-only staff can't see them.
-- So are coaching sessions; only the student's coach changes an open one, and a submitted one never changes.
-- Coaches and admins can do everything with the master exercise list. Students
-- can't see it at all. The same goes for its purposes.
